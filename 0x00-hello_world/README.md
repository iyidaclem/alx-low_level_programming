## C - Hello, World 

Learning the basics of C programming language

## Files
All of the following files are scripts:

## [`0-preprocessor`](0-preprocessor)
Write a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.

* The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE
* The output should be saved in the file c

## [`1-compiler`](1-compiler)
Write a script that compiles a C file but does not link.

* The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE
* The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .o instead of .c.
* Example: if the C file is main.c, the output file should be main.o

## [`2-assembler`](2-assembler)
Write a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.

* The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE
* The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c.
* Example: if the C file is main.c, the output file should be main.s

## [`3-name`](3-name)
 script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun.

* The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE

## [`4-puts.c`](4-puts.c)
A C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.

* Use the function puts
* You are not allowed to use printf
* Your program should end with the value 0



[`5-printf.c`](5-printf.c)
Write a C program that prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,, followed by a new line. Use the function printf You are not allowed to use the function puts Your program should return 0 Your program should compile without warning when using the -Wall gcc option

[`6-size.c`](6-size.c)
Write a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on. \n\* You should produce the exact same output as in the example \n\* Warnings are allowed \n\* Your program should return 0 \n\* You might have to install the package libc6-dev-i386 on your Linux to test the -m32 gcc option

[`100-intel`](100-intel)
Write a script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file. The C file name will be saved in the variable main.c. The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c. Example: if the C file is main.c, the output file should be main.s

[`101-quote.c`](101-quote.c)
Write a C program that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful

[`101-quote.c`](101-quote.c)
Write a C program that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful

[`101-quote.c`](101-quote.c)
Write a C program that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful
