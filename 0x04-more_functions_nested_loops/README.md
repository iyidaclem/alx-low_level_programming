## C - More functions, more nested loops

## Files
Below are the names of files and the description of the task that was solved inside:

## [`0-isupper.c`](0-isupper.c)
Write a function that checks for uppercase character.
* Prototype: int _isupper(int c);
* Returns 1 if c is uppercase
* Returns 0 otherwise

## [`1-isdigit.c`](1-isdigit.c)
Write a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).
* Prototype: int _isdigit(int c);
* Returns 1 if c is a digit
* Returns 0 otherwise

## [`2-mul.c`](2-mul.c)
Write a function that multiplies two integers.
Prototype: int mul(int a, int b);

## [`3-print_numbers.c`](3-print_numbers.c)
Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
* Prototype: void print_numbers(void);
* You can only use _putchar twice in your code

## [`4-print_most_numbers.c`](4-print_most_numbers.c)
Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void print_most_numbers(void);
Do not print 2 and 4
You can only use _putchar twice in your code


## [`5-more_numbers.c`](5-more_numbers.c)
Write a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void more_numbers(void);
You can only use _putchar three times in your code
